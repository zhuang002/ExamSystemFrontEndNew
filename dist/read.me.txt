Set up and run ExamSystem

Steps:

1. Unzip the distribute package. Read the read.me file which is this one.
2. Install mysql server using default configurations.
3. Install mySqlWorkbench application.
4. Connect mySqlWorkbench and login as the root user.
5. Create a schema (database) named as examsystem.
6. Run examsys.sql in this directory to set up all the necessary tables,views and demo data. 
	In mySqlWorkbench choose File->Run SQL Script...
7. Using mySqlWorkbench to add a new user which is used by the program to access the mysql database. 
	username: examsys
	password: examsys
	Then grant all privileges to the user.
	In mySqlWorkbench, choose Server->Users and Privileges, then click Add Acount button.
8. Run the ExamFrontendNew.jar (Assume you have installed the JRE correctly with path set)

Demo data

1. admin/admin is Role.Admin to have all the features, including maintain all users, problems, exams and reports.
But take exam is not allowed.
2. Teacher1/Teacher1 is Role.Teacher who can maintain students,problems, exams and reports. A teacher can see 
all students' reports. A teacher cannot take exam.
3. Teacher2/Teacher2 is same as Teacher2
4. Student1/Student1 is Role.Student who can take exam and see only his/her reports.
5. 4 Problems has been added. 
6. 2 Exams has been added.
7. No reports is added. Reports can be generated if a student take one of the exam.

Logics to be noted.
1. Menus are changed for different roles in order to restrict the role's functions.
2. Admin can manage all users. Teacher can manage students.
3. Only students can take exam.
4. A fresh exam can be changed when it is not yet be taken by any students. When a student has taken the exam, 
a report is automatically generated and thus the exam cannot be changed.
5. If a student has taken an exam, he is not allowed to take that exam again. As a result the exam is not shown
in the choosing list. But other student that has not taken the exam can still do it.
6. Reports are auto generated thus can only be viewed. 
7. Students are enrolled by admins or teachers, but they cannot register by themselves.
8. All deleted users, exams problems are not actually deleted from the database. A 'deleted' status is set instead
of actual deletion. In this way we can still access a report even the related student or the problems of the exam are 
deleted. Same thing applies to all entries. But these 'deleted' entries will not shown in the selection lists.

Features not implemented:
1. Student self registration.
2. Teacher modify the reports.

As a demo project it is quite sophisticated and complete. Enjoy it.
